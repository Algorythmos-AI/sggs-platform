# The iOS app

**Gurbani Soul** is the consumer app: reading, searching and studying Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji,
fully offline, with the verbatim [[Gurmukhi]] cited by [[Ang]]. It lives in
[`Algorythmos-AI/gurbani-soul-ios`](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/gurbani-soul-ios) and
**reads nothing from this repository's working tree**: every input arrives pinned and hash-verified
([ADR-0007](../adr/0007-three-repositories.md)), and its Swift search, verify and reader core is
held to the platform's API by the golden contract.

| Input | Owner | How it arrives in the app repository |
|---|---|---|
| The scripture database | sggs-data | `dataset.lock.json` — the same pin as this platform — installed by `make dataset`, sha256-verified |
| The iOS database builder (`pipeline/build_ios_db.py`) | sggs-data | vendored at the dataset's commit, recorded in `vendor.lock.json` |
| The golden contract (`contract/`) and the contributors roster | this platform | vendored at a release tag, recorded in `vendor.lock.json` with a sha256 per file |

## The pages

<!-- sggs:cards -->
- [What the app does](what-the-app-does.md) — the five tabs screen by screen, the widgets and Live Activity, Siri and deep links, settings, what the public build leaves out, accessibility
- [App architecture](architecture.md) — the Swift package (a Foundation-only core, a vendored SQLite, a read-only seam), the actor that answers the API's routes on the device, the widget extension, the tests
- [Privacy and on-device data](privacy-and-on-device-data.md) — what is stored where, what the widgets see, no network, what sharing sends, deletion, the privacy manifest and its tests
- [Release status](release-status.md) — every upload from the app's ledger (rendered at build) and the first App Store submission's sign-off record
- [How the app takes a release](how-the-app-takes-a-release.md) — vendor-sync, the one version number, the ledger, and what makes a release *complete* (the flow as a sequence diagram; the tools read from the app repository at its pinned commit)
- [Contract and parity](contract-and-parity.md) — how the Swift port is proven byte-identical to the API, suite by suite (the Swift fold read from the source)
- [Database pair and launch integrity](db-pair-and-launch-integrity.md) — the two database profiles, the manifest, the licence gate, the fail-closed launch check, the bookmarks store (poster 12 walkthrough)
- [Nitnem for engineers](nitnem-for-engineers.md) — the bani registry as pointers over the verbatim corpus, the separate non-SGGS layer, variants, numbering, the review gate (the registry as a diagram)

## What the app promises

- **Verbatim scripture.** Every line shown is the Gurmukhi of the pinned database; the app refuses
  to present scripture at all if the bundled database does not hash to its certified manifest.
- **The platform's behaviour.** Search, verification, the reader, timing, the banis and the
  insights are Swift ports proven against the golden contract of the release they carry the
  number of.
- **One number.** `MARKETING_VERSION` equals the platform release whose contract is vendored;
  every platform release is re-archived as `X.Y.Z (1)`, so the App Store always equals the site.
- **Nothing collected.** No accounts, no network at runtime, no tracking; the privacy manifest
  declares only what the app stores on the device.

Identifiers are stable through the brand: bundle ids `org.sggs.*`, the App Group
`group.org.sggs`, the URL scheme `sggs://` ([Brand & domains](../engineering/brand.md)).
