# Runbook: the docs site (launch and after)

The wiki (`docs-site/` over `docs/`, [ADR-0012](../../adr/0012-docs-site.md)) deploys through
`deploy-docs.yml` with the product's posture: CI builds, deploys, smokes by commit, promotes, rolls
back; the Vercel project's own git deployments are off. This runbook is the launch checklist and
the routine that follows it.

## 1. One-time setup (owner)

The Vercel project, the domain, the staging alias and the two secrets — steps 1–5 of
[the deploy runbook's wiki section](deploy.md#the-wiki-docsgurbanisoulcom--one-time-setup-owner).
Until they exist, every push to `integration` still runs the full `docs` job (the required check),
and `deploy-staging` fails clearly at preflight.

Then apply the ruleset that makes the docs job required:

```bash
REPO=Algorythmos-AI/sggs-platform bash scripts/gh/apply_rulesets.sh --dry-run   # prints the change
REPO=Algorythmos-AI/sggs-platform bash scripts/gh/apply_rulesets.sh
```

### The pin bot's token (`DOCS_BOT_TOKEN`)

`docs-pins` opens its pull request with a fine-grained personal access token, so the required checks
run on it (a pull request opened with the workflow's own token would trigger none). At
<https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Resource owner | **Algorythmos-AI** — not your personal account (it cannot be changed later) |
| Repository access | Only select repositories → `sggs-platform` |
| Repository permissions | **Contents** and **Pull requests**: Read and write (nothing else) |
| Expiration | 90 days, with a renewal reminder |

If the organization requires approval, approve it under Organization settings → Personal access
tokens → Pending requests. Then `gh secret set DOCS_BOT_TOKEN --repo Algorythmos-AI/sggs-platform`
(a hidden prompt; never paste a token into chat or a file).

Before it writes anything, the workflow checks the token with a dry-run push. A token that
authenticates but cannot push — a personal resource owner, pending approval, read-only Contents —
does not fail silently: the bump arrives as the issue *docs: the sibling docs changed — bump the
pins*, which names the cause. An expired or removed token does the same.

## 2. Staging walkthrough (before the first promotion)

Most of this walkthrough is automated now. After every staging deploy `deploy-docs` runs the
**live suite** (`docs-site/e2e-live/live.spec.ts`) against the staging alias with the real API: the
status strip, the search simulator, the Ang explorer on Angs 1, 712 and 1256, a line read from
`/api/ang/1` verifying as `VERIFIED_EXACT`, the API console, ⌘K search, axe on five pages as
deployed, and no Content-Security-Policy errors. Run it by hand with
`make docs-live URL=https://docs.gurbanisoul.com` (add `VERCEL_BYPASS=…` for the staging alias).
What stays human is taste: one visual pass on a new release.

Open `https://sggs-docs-staging.vercel.app` logged in to Vercel. Run the visual pass the build
cannot judge — the same list the repository's QA script shoots
(`cd docs-site && node scripts/visual-qa.mjs <url>` writes light, dark and phone screenshots of
every section under `docs-site/qa-shots/`):

| Check | Where |
|---|---|
| The landing, the live status strip shows production's version and health | `/` |
| A poster walkthrough: Next, arrow keys, a step chip, Full size, Escape returns focus | `/architecture/request-lifecycle/` |
| The Ang explorer on Angs 1, 712, 1256; the English toggle; the outage message with the network off | `/data/line-record/` |
| The search simulator with `sat nam`, `waheguru`, `mercy`, a Gurmukhi query; the tier lights on poster 05 | `/architecture/search-waterfall/` |
| The verify playground with a line from memory; the rung lights on poster 07 | `/search/verification-engine/` |
| The API console: an Ang, a search, copy as curl | `/api/` |
| A pinned page's canonical banner and edit link | `/data/architecture/database-schema/`, `/ios/nitnem/spec/` |
| Hover-cards and a quiz; the two cited lines stack Gurmukhi, transliteration, citation | `/scripture/what-sggs-is/` |
| A learning path's ticks survive a reload | `/learning-paths/platform-engineer/` |
| Search (⌘K) finds a technical term and a scripture term | any page |
| Dark mode on every section; phone width with no horizontal scroll | every section |
| The 404 page; a page's Open Graph card (`/og/<id>.png`) | `/nope/`, `/og/index.png` |

Anything wrong is a normal pull request into `integration`; the site redeploys to staging on merge.

## 3. Production

1. Cloudflare: `CNAME docs →` Vercel's recommended target, DNS-only. Vercel: the domain is attached to
   `sggs-docs` and shows *Valid Configuration*.
2. Merge the next release PR `integration → main` (a merge commit, as always). `deploy-docs`'s
   `deploy-production` job records the deployment the domain serves now (the rollback target),
   builds, deploys unaliased, smokes by commit, promotes to `docs.gurbanisoul.com`, smokes again —
   and rolls back if the public smoke fails. Every failure opens an issue that says whether
   production changed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > **A project's first Vercel deployment became production.** On 2026-09-26 the docs
   > project's first deployment — a *preview* from `deploy-staging` — was recorded as production,
   > and `docs.gurbanisoul.com` attached to it, so the domain served an `integration` build until
   > the 1.3.10 release. `deploy-staging` now refuses to run while the project has no production
   > deployment (`scripts/ci/vercel_api.py has-production`) and fails if its own deployment is not
   > a preview. For a new Vercel project, the first deployment must come from `deploy-production`.
3. Prove it:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/ci/docs_smoke.py https://docs.gurbanisoul.com --commit <sha>
   ```

   The smoke checks the landing, a Mermaid render, the search index, `/api/health` and `/api/meta`
   through the rewrite, the poster the architecture page links as "open full size" and an Open
   Graph card, and that `<meta name="sggs-docs-commit">` equals the commit. Nothing may redirect:
   a redirect on `/api` is how the widgets broke before launch (`trailingSlash`).
4. Owner walkthrough of section 2 on the public domain, once.

## 4. Rollback

The job rolls back on its own when the public smoke fails **after** promotion, to the deployment
the domain served before the run (read from Vercel by the domain, never "the newest production
deployment": a build deployed with `--skip-domain` whose smoke failed is also a READY production
deployment, but it never served anyone). A failure before promotion changes nothing and says so in
its issue. By hand: `python3 scripts/ci/vercel_api.py live docs.gurbanisoul.com` names the serving
deployment; Vercel → `sggs-docs` → Deployments → the previous good deployment → *Instant Rollback*,
or `vercel rollback <previous-url> --scope <team>` with the docs project's token. After a rollback
Vercel stops assigning the domain automatically; the next `deploy-production` run's `vercel promote`
restores it. The wiki carries no state, so a rollback costs nothing but the newer pages.

## 5. After launch: the routine

| When | What |
|---|---|
| every pull request | the `docs` check (required on `integration` and `main`): gates, build, links, budgets, CSP, e2e, axe on every page, Lighthouse on five pages (all twenty nightly and on `main`) — about nine minutes |
| a dataset bump lands | nothing to do: the docs job installs the pinned database and re-verifies the cited lines |
| every 15 minutes | `uptime` probes the wiki's landing page and `/api/health` through its rewrite; issue *uptime: docs site probe failing* |
| every 6 hours | `docs-watch`: the domain serves the last deployed commit, the smoke and the live suite pass; issue *docs-watch: production wiki check failing* (after a manual rollback it stays open until the next release — expected) |
| every night | the `docs` job re-runs on `integration`; issue *docs: nightly wiki build failing* while red |
| Mondays | `docs-links` checks every external link (issue *docs: broken external links*); `security` scans the history; `docs-pins` opens *docs(wiki): bump the sibling docs pins* when a sibling changed a published file (or issue *docs: the sibling docs changed — bump the pins* until `DOCS_BOT_TOKEN` exists); `docs-freshness` rewrites issue *docs: wiki pages to re-verify* |
| a page is in *wiki pages to re-verify* | re-read it against the code it cites, fix what drifted, move its `verified` stamp; the issue closes itself when every page is fresh |
| a scholar review is due | `make review-pack` writes one PDF — Scripture 101, the glossary's scripture and script sections, the contributors — with a sign-off sheet |
| a new page | frontmatter, links, the scripture rule and the fallback rule are gated; a poster or a widget follows [the contributing guides](../../contributing/README.md) |

## 6. Sibling README links

Done (2026-09-26): both sibling READMEs open with a line pointing at the wiki's published copy of
their docs ([sggs-data#11](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data/pull/11),
[gurbani-soul-ios#19](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/gurbani-soul-ios/pull/19)).

## 7. Open review items

- The scholar review of [Scripture 101](../../scripture/README.md), the glossary's
  scripture terms and the contributors chronology. `make review-pack` builds the PDF with a
  sign-off sheet.
- Resolved: sggs-data's `database-schema.md` now states the database's counts (4,527 compositions,
  `max(comp_id)` 5,376), and `pipeline/tests/test_docs_facts.py` there holds them to the database.
