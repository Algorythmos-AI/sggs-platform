# The engineering wiki

An offline, sovereign, zero-dependency study application over the complete
**Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji** (Angs 1–1430). A reproducible pipeline extracts the
source PDF into a verbatim corpus, builds a SQLite/FTS5 database, and a Python
standard-library server serves a prebuilt Astro site and a native iOS app.

> **Prime directive:** the Gurmukhi text is sacred and **verbatim**. It is never
> edited, normalized, or corrected. Every change is proven against the source PDF.
> See [Scripture integrity](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data/blob/main/docs/architecture/scripture-integrity.md) (in sggs-data).

<!-- sggs:status -->
On the rendered wiki this line shows what production is serving right now — version, commit,
build date, dataset build and the health checks — read live from `/api/health`.

![Poster 01 — The system landscape: the people, the three surfaces (web, iOS, API), the one read-only API, the pinned database, and where the verbatim text comes from](diagrams/posters/01-system-landscape.svg)

## Ten minutes to your first search

1. Clone the platform: `git clone https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-platform.git && cd sggs-platform`
2. `make doctor` — checks Python 3.12, Node 22 and whether the database is installed.
3. `make dataset` — downloads the pinned database (~104 MiB), verifies its sha256, installs it.
4. `cd webapp && python3 serve.py` — the API and the website on <http://localhost:7777>.
5. Search. Every line comes back verbatim, with its Ang — or try it here, against production:

<!-- sggs:waterfall q="sat nam" limit="3" -->
On the rendered wiki this is the search simulator: it runs the query against the live API and
lights the tier of the waterfall that answered. On GitHub, run
`curl -s 'http://localhost:7777/api/search?q=sat%20nam&limit=3'` after step 4.

The whole walk-through, with what to do when a step fails: [Run it locally](onboarding/run-it-locally.md).

## Choose your path

<!-- sggs:cards -->
- [Platform engineer](learning-paths/platform-engineer.md) — the API, the search and verification engines, the data pin and the delivery pipeline, in order.
- [Data engineer](learning-paths/data-engineer.md) — the line record, the corpus pipeline and its gates, the editorial ledger, and how a dataset reaches production.
- [iOS engineer](learning-paths/ios-engineer.md) — Gurbani Soul: the contract and parity, the database pair and launch integrity, Nitnem, and how the app takes a release.
- [Reviewer or scholar](learning-paths/reviewer-scholar.md) — what the project promises, where the text is proven, what a review checks, and how to say no.

| `dataset.lock.json` | The sggs-data commit + database sha256 this platform serves (`make dataset` installs it). |
| `webapp/serve.py` | Stdlib HTTP server + JSON API. |
| `frontend/` | Astro multi-page UI (build output synced into `webapp/static/`). |
| `tools/` | Golden-vector + OpenAPI generators, HTTP contract replay, search harnesses. |
| `contract/` | Golden vectors pinning the Swift port (vendored by the iOS app) to the Python source of truth. |
