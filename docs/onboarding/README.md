# Start here — your first week

Welcome. This project is a study application over **Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji**, the scripture and
living Guru of the Sikhs: a verbatim corpus of its 1,430 Angs, a search and verification engine, a
website ([gurbanisoul.com](https://gurbanisoul.com)) and an iOS app (Gurbani Soul). You do not need
to know Sikh scripture, [[Gurmukhi]] or Punjabi to contribute. You do need to work with the text the way
this project does: **verbatim, cited, never altered.**

## The one rule

> **The Gurmukhi text is sacred and verbatim.** It is never edited, normalised, "corrected",
> reordered or paraphrased — not in the data, not in code, not in a test fixture, not in a document.
> If something looks wrong, you open a *scripture fidelity* issue for a Granthi or scholar; you never
> change it. Everything else in this wiki bends around this rule.

The [reverence checklist](reverence-checklist.md) turns this into concrete habits for everyday
engineering work. Read it before you touch anything that displays, searches, copies or stores text.

## Five days to a merged change

    accDescr: Day one read the rule and the map; day two run everything locally; day three read the invariants and trace one request; day four open a small pull request; day five watch it through CI, staging and the owner's merge.

```

| Day | Do | Read |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Understand what the system is, why it is split into three repositories, and where each kind of change belongs. | [How the repositories fit together](how-the-repos-fit.md) · [Architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md) · [Reverence checklist](reverence-checklist.md) |
| 2 | Clone, install the pinned database, run the server, the website and this wiki on your machine; run the gates. | [Run it locally](run-it-locally.md) |
| 3 | Read the rules every change must keep, then follow one search request from the browser to SQLite. | [Engineering invariants](../engineering/invariants.md) · [Search waterfall](../architecture/search-waterfall.md) · [Glossary](../glossary.md) |
| 4 | Pick a small change, branch from `integration`, open a pull request the way the project expects. | [Your first pull request](your-first-pr.md) · [Branching](../process/branching.md) |
| 5 | Watch the checks, read what each one proves, see your change on staging, ask for the merge. | [CI gates](../process/ci-gates.md) · [Who to ask](who-to-ask.md) |

## Three sentences to remember

1. **Scripture is data you never write.** It arrives from the pinned database and is shown with its
   [[Ang]]: *Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji · Ang N*. Explanation is always labelled as explanation.
2. **Everything is proven by CI.** You cannot merge; the owner merges after every check is green and
   the change has been seen on staging. A deploy is verified by the running *commit*, not a version.
3. **Small, reviewed, reversible.** One change per pull request, a conventional-commit title, the
   PR template filled in, and no tool attribution in commits — only the author's name.

## What you can contribute

Almost everything outside the scripture itself: search quality, the verification engine, the API,
the website, the iOS app, documentation, diagrams, tests, tooling and the wiki you are reading.
The [learning paths](../learning-paths/README.md) group these by role, each a checklist of pages
and exercises in order; the [engineering handbook](../engineering/README.md) is the map of the rules.
