# Brand & domains

Product identity. Read before touching names, URLs, or visual identity.

Endorsed-brand architecture, set 2026-09-17 ahead of the first public TestFlight/App Store release:

- **Company:** **Algorythmos Pty Ltd** — the Australian legal entity that owns the IP, the Apple/Google developer accounts, and the infrastructure. Credited as an *endorsed brand* ("Built by Algorythmos"). Its strongest trademark asset is the coined word **"Algorythmos"** itself.
- **Consumer app (iOS):** **Gurbani Soul** — the product users download. This is the App Store **Name**, the iOS on-device label (`CFBundleDisplayName`/`CFBundleName` = `Gurbani Soul`), the widget-group name, and the About-screen title. Positioning leads with **trust** ("verbatim, cited by Ang, never AI-invented"), not "AI".
- **Website / Knowledge Base (this repo):** stays **"Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji — Knowledge Base"** — a *distinct, scholarly property* from the consumer app. Its page titles/header use the full scripture name. Do **not** rename the KB site to "Gurbani Soul".
- **Scripture citations, everywhere (web + app):** always the full **"Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji · Ang N"**. "Gurbani Soul" names the *app*, never the *text*. Keep this separation.
- **Product domain:** **`gurbanisoul.com`** — registered 2026-09-17 at **Hostinger** (registrar), **2-year term, auto-renew on, WHOIS privacy on**. DNS is delegated to **Cloudflare** (account label *"Company-Domains"*), nameservers `jamie.ns.cloudflare.com` / `luke.ns.cloudflare.com`. The Cloudflare **Zone ID / Account ID live in the Cloudflare dashboard, not in this repo** — never paste them (or any API token) into tracked files.
  - **LIVE as of 1.3.3.** The site is one Astro build served on the apex: `/` is the **Gurbani Soul** landing (marketing), and the **Knowledge Base** keeps its own name/theme under `/search`, `/reader`, … Support/Privacy are **paths** on the apex (`/support`, `/privacy`), so one domain satisfies Apple's URL fields. `docs.gurbanisoul.com` serves this wiki (live since 1.3.10); there is no `api.` subdomain — the API is same-origin under `/api`. Full topology + DNS + email routing: `docs/website/README.md`.
  - **Canonical rule:** the **bare apex `gurbanisoul.com` is canonical** (200, no redirect); `www` and the legacy Vercel alias 308→apex. `<link rel="canonical">`, `og:url` and the sitemap all use the bare apex. Public contact is **`support@gurbanisoul.com`** (a Zoho Mail alias → owner; DNS in `docs/website/README.md`). Never re-introduce the legacy Vercel production alias as a URL in app code, listing, monitors or docs (the `DocsHygiene` + `test_app_links_use_the_canonical_host` gates enforce this; the literal host is named only in `docs/process/environments.md` and `docs/website/README.md`, which record the domain topology).
  - `.app` / `.ai` are optional **defensive** buys for later, not on the launch path.
- **Availability caveats that were verified (Sep 2026, non-authoritative — re-check before spend):** no App Store/Play app named "Gurbani Soul" and no matching company/trademark found. Trademark note: "Gurbani AI" would be descriptive→generic and weak; **India has a religious-susceptibilities bar (TM Act s.9(2)(b))** on Sikh/scriptural terms plus active Akal Takht scrutiny of AI-Gurbani tools — file logos/composites, prioritise protecting "Algorythmos", and get professional clearance in AU/US/India before filing.
- **Visual identity (iOS app) — governed by `docs/brand/gurbani-soul-brand-book.md`** (set 2026-09-18). `docs/brand/tokens.json` is the palette source of truth; `python3 scripts/brand/contrast_report.py` must exit 0 after any colour change. Default accent is **Soul Gold** (`AccentPalette.brandDefault`). The literal brand gold `#FFBC0D` is **`accentFill` only** (prominent fills, always with an `accent` border) — it is 1.69:1 on white, so never use it for text, icons, tint or links; use `accent` / `accentText`. Brand red `#DA291C` is fill-only (badges), never text and never beside Gurmukhi. Headings use **Source Serif 4** via `Brand.heading` (navigation titles + hero lines only); Gurmukhi is always ink-coloured Sant Lipi. Dark mode is warm ink everywhere — new List screens use `inkGroupedList()`/`inkPlainList()`/`inkRow()`. **Never** make a gold mark on a red square (another company's trade dress). Brand gates G3 (sensitivity: a Granthi or scholar) and G4 (legal) were closed on 2026-09-26 for the first App Store submission (brand book §12). The website keeps its own theme.
- **Internal identifiers are unchanged and must stay so:** bundle ids `org.sggs.*`, App Group `group.org.sggs`, URL scheme `sggs://`, Xcode targets, npm `sggs-frontend`, the DB filename, and the SKU `sggs-ios`. The brand is a display layer; none of these track it.
