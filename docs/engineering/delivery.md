# Delivery, versioning & release

How work reaches users. Read before shipping.

## Versioning convention (important)

- **`APP_VERSION` in `webapp/serve.py` is the source of truth** for the running build. Bump it on every search-logic/UI release.
- **One number, everywhere.** The web footer, `/api/meta`, `/api/health`, the iOS About screen (`MARKETING_VERSION`) and the App Store all report the same X.Y.Z; they are **never allowed to differ** (`check_versions.py` gates this repository's 5 strings; the app repository requires its `MARKETING_VERSION` to equal the platform release it vendors, and its ledger never to lead it). **Every release is re-archived at the same version** and uploaded as iOS `X.Y.Z (1)` from the release tag `vX.Y.Z`, even a web-only change — so the App Store number always equals the live site. The **build number restarts at 1 per version** (only a re-upload of the *same* version increments it). A release is *complete* only when `scripts/release/check_release_complete.py X.Y.Z` passes (prod web+API at the tag commit **and** an `appstore` ledger entry of X.Y.Z from that commit). Never ship a one-sided hotfix — patch-bump both surfaces.
- The DB's own build version is returned separately as `db_version` and is **not** shown in the UI. This decoupling is intentional: the data releases on its own cadence (see below).
- Keep `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `MASTER-INDEX.md` in step when you bump (`scripts/release/bump.py` does it).
- **The dataset versions separately.** It is built and versioned in `Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data`: every build stamps the database's `meta.version` (served as `db_version`) with sggs-data's `DATASET_VERSION`, and `dataset.lock.json` records it as `dataset_version`. The database pinned today was built on 2026-09-18, before that rule, so `/api/meta` reports `db_version` 1.1.4 while the lock says 1.0.0; the next rebuild makes them one number. This repository serves exactly the object `dataset.lock.json` pins; a new dataset arrives as a reviewed lock bump, never with an unrelated app change.

## Delivery SOP — how work reaches users (read before shipping)
**Environments:** `integration` = trunk → auto-deploys **staging** (`sggs-staging.vercel.app`, SSO-protected; the API runs as Vercel functions inside it). `main` = **production** (web on the canonical domain **`gurbanisoul.com`**; `www` and the legacy `*.vercel.app` alias 308→apex; the API runs as Vercel functions inside it from the release after 1.3.9, with the Render single API `…onrender.com` kept deploying as the rollback target). Both deploy **only** through CI (`deploy-staging.yml` / `deploy-production.yml`); the platforms' own git auto-deploys are OFF and Render auto-deploy is OFF. Never deploy by hand except a documented pipeline-outage hotfix.

**The loop (use the tooling below; do not improvise it):**
1. **Ship**: branch from `integration` (`fix/…`, `feat/…`), run local gates, open a PR into `integration`, watch CI green. Corpus/DB change? It happens in [sggs-data](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data) first (scripture proofs); here it arrives as a reviewed `dataset.lock.json` bump. You cannot merge — hand the user the exact `--admin` command (one line, no comments).
2. The user merges → the push auto-deploys **staging**. Review on `sggs-staging.vercel.app` (open logged in to Vercel).
3. **Release**: preflight → PR `integration→main` as a **merge commit** (never squash — `main` must stay a descendant of `integration`) → the merge runs the gated production deploy → verify with `make verify-prod` and confirm the `vX.Y.Z` tag.

**Invariants:** a deploy is verified by the running **commit** (`/api/health.commit`), not just the version. The release tag is cut only after a verified deploy. Secrets live in GitHub Environments (`production`/`staging`) — never type or echo a value; if one is pasted into chat, treat it as leaked and have the user rotate it. Full detail: `docs/process/runbooks/deploy.md`, `docs/process/branching.md`, ADR-0005.

## Delivery tooling

Tested scripts that encode the gotchas learned shipping v1.1.x. Prefer them to ad-hoc commands:

| Step | Command | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Watch a PR's checks to completion | `make pr-checks PR=<n>` | `scripts/ci/wait_pr_checks.sh` |
| Release preflight (trunk green, versions unified, CHANGELOG section) | `make release-preflight` | `scripts/release/release_preflight.sh` |
| Watch the production deploy gate by gate | `make watch-deploy [SHA=<sha>]` | `scripts/release/watch_deploy.sh` |
| Prove what production serves (commit, health, Ang 712 heading, web deployment) | `make verify-prod [ARGS="--commit <sha> --version X.Y.Z"]` | `scripts/ops/verify_prod.py` |
| Install / check the pinned database | `make dataset` · `make dataset-check` | `scripts/data/fetch_dataset.py` |

## iOS app (Gurbani Soul)
The app lives in [`Algorythmos-AI/gurbani-soul-ios`](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/gurbani-soul-ios). It builds against this repository's golden contract, vendored at a pinned platform release (`vendor.lock.json` there), and its `MARKETING_VERSION` must equal that release's `APP_VERSION` — the one-number policy, enforced by its CI. After a release is tagged `vX.Y.Z` here, that repository runs `make vendor-sync-platform REF=vX.Y.Z`, sets `MARKETING_VERSION`, and uploads `X.Y.Z (1)` with `make testflight … CHANNEL=appstore` (the archive refuses an App Store upload whose contract was not vendored from `vX.Y.Z`). Its ledger records the platform commit each binary was built against; `scripts/release/check_release_complete.py X.Y.Z` reads it from there to prove web, API and the binary report the same number from the same commit. TestFlight/App Store runbooks, plans and the store listing live in that repository.
