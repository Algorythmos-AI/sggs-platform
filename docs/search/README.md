# Search & verification

Two engines, one rule: **the text is never guessed**. Search returns verbatim lines with their [[Ang]]
or nothing; verification returns a verdict with the canonical line or `NOT_FOUND`. Both fold Roman
input with the same function the database was built with, and both are pinned by golden vectors
that every deploy and the iOS app replay.

<!-- sggs:cards -->
- [Search waterfall](../architecture/search-waterfall.md) — The cascade as `do_search` codes it (Poster 05 · a simulator over the real API)
- [Modes and tiers](modes-and-tiers.md) — Each `mode` you can ask for, each tier's entry condition, what it queries, what it reports (The same simulator, focused on modes)
- [The Roman fold](the-roman-fold.md) — The five steps of `roman_norm` and why it lives in three repositories (Poster 06 · the function read from the source)
- [Verification engine](verification-engine.md) — The verdict ladder, the thresholds, the Ang modifier (Poster 07 · a playground over `/api/verify`)
- [Harnesses and golden vectors](harnesses-and-golden-vectors.md) — What roundtrip, casual-quote and chaos measure; what `make contract` pins (The contract files and their counts)

Search is the `search` bounded context (`/api/search`, `/api/word`); verification is the `verify`
context (`/api/verify`). Both are read-only over the immutable database — see the
[API routes](../api/routes.md).
