# The structure of the Granth

The Granth is one long, deliberately ordered text. Press *Next* on the poster to build it up; every
number on it is read from the pinned database, which the tables below list in full.

![Poster 13 — The structure of the Granth: Angs 1–1430 as one bar with the opening banis, the thirty-one raags, the closing sections, the twenty-two Vaars and the voices](../diagrams/posters/13-structure-of-the-granth.svg)

## Three parts

1. **The opening, Angs 1–13.** The [[Mool Mantar]] and [[Japji]] Sahib (385 lines,
   Angs 1–8), then So Dar, So Purakh and Sohila — the [[Sohila|evening and night prayers]].
   In the database these are the first four named sections; Japji's lines carry `author = null`
   because the print has no ਮਹਲਾ line for it.
2. **The raags, Angs 14–1353.** Thirty-one [[Raag|raags]], from `ਸਿਰੀਰਾਗੁ` on Ang 14 to `ਜੈਜਾਵੰਤੀ` on
   Ang 1353. Inside a raag the compositions run through the Gurus in order, then the Bhagats; the
   headings name the Guru as [[Mahalla]] (`ਮਹਲਾ ੧` to `੫`, and `੯`). A raag's *span* in the database
   is the longest run of Angs where it is the majority, so a liturgical mention of a raag elsewhere
   never drags its start.
3. **After the raags, Angs 1353–1430.** The [[Sahaskriti]] saloks, Gatha, Phunhe and Chaubole, the
   Bhatts' [[Swaiyye]], the saloks beyond the Vaars, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji's
   saloks, [[Mundavani]] — the seal — and [[Raagmala]]. The database clears the raag column from
   Ang 1353 (`POST_RAAG_ANG`) and detects these sections from their headings.

Q: Which Ang does the first raag begin on?
- Ang 14 ✓ — after Japji Sahib, So Dar, So Purakh and Sohila
- Ang 1 — Ang 1 opens with the Mool Mantar and Japji, which are not in a raag
- Ang 1353 — that is where the last raag ends and the closing sections begin
Q: Why does the database clear the raag column from Ang 1353?
- Because the Granth leaves the raag framework there ✓ — the closing sections are detected from their headings instead
- Because the source PDF is missing those pages — every one of the 1,430 Angs is present, gap-free
- Because those Angs have no headings — they have headings; they are simply not raag headings
Q: How is a raag's span computed?
- The longest run of Angs where the raag is the majority ✓ — so a liturgical mention elsewhere cannot drag its start
- Every Ang where the raag's name appears — that would make spans overlap
- The Angs listed in Raagmala — Raagmala is an index of raags, not of pages
