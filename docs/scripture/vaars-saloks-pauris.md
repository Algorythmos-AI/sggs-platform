A **[[Vaar]]** is a ballad: a sequence of [[Pauri|pauris]] — stanzas — each preceded, in
the Granth's arrangement, by one or more [[Salok|saloks]], couplet-style verses. The
pauris are by one author; the saloks that go with them are drawn from several Gurus and carry
their own [[Mahalla]] headers. Twenty-two Vaars sit inside the raags; the pinned database lists
them like this:

| # | Raag | Angs | Pauris | Saloks | Pauris by | Salok authors |

## Why attribution needs a rule

Read line by line, a Vaar looks like a stream of alternating authors: a salok of Guru Nanak Dev Ji,
a salok of Guru Angad Dev Ji, then a pauri. The pauri belongs to the Vaar's author even though the
line just before it carried another Guru's `ਮਃ` header. So the pipeline gives a Vaar's pauris the
Vaar's author (`vaar_author`), never the author of the preceding salok — one of the engineering
[invariants](../engineering/invariants.md). The Vaar with no saloks is Satta and Balwand's
(Angs 966–968), the one composition in the Granth by those two authors; the short Vaar on Ang 1193
is Guru Arjan Dev Ji's in Basant.

## Detected by title, not by shape

Twenty-two is the count of Vaars **by title header** — a heading carrying `ਵਾਰ` with `ਕੀ` or
`ਧੁਨੀ`. Detecting Vaars structurally, by runs of pauris, over- and under-counts, so the pipeline
never does it. The `vaars` and `vaar_units` tables in the database hold every Vaar's anatomy —
`/api/analytics/vaars` and `/api/analytics/vaar?id=N` serve them — and `golden_analytics.ndjson`
pins the count.

## In the app

The daily banis include Asa Ki Vaar (Vaar 5 above, Angs 462–475), read both as printed and in its
kirtan interleave with the chhants of Angs 448–451 — two [[Nitnem]] variants of one registry key —
and a Vaar's pauri numbers come only from the markers the scripture prints
([Nitnem for engineers](../ios/nitnem-for-engineers.md)).
