# Transliteration and the fold

Beside every line the database keeps a **[[Transliteration|transliteration]]** — the line in Roman
letters, built by the pipeline from the Gurmukhi:

> ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥  
> *ik oankaar sat naam karataa purakh nirabhau niravair akaal moorat ajoonee saibhn gur prasaad*  
> — Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji · Ang 1

It is a reading aid for people who do not read Gurmukhi, and a search key. It is **not** scripture:
it is never cited, never verified, never shown alone. Several Roman schemes exist and none is
canonical; the pipeline's is consistent, and that consistency is what search needs.

## What the fold is for

Seekers type a Gurmukhi word the way they hear it: *waheguru*, *vaahiguroo*, *wahegurooh*. A search
that demanded the pipeline's exact spelling would miss most of them. The **fold** — `roman_norm` —
reduces every spelling of a word to one key by five rules (letter substitutions, digraphs, voicing
pairs, the y glide, vowels dropped and doubles collapsed), so *waheguru* and *vaahiguroo* both
become `vhgr`. The database stores the folded form of every line's transliteration
(`translit_norm`), and the query is folded the same way at search time.

The fold is deliberately lossy: it trades precision for recall, which is why the
[search waterfall](../architecture/search-waterfall.md) tries it only after the exact tiers, and
why the [verification engine](../search/verification-engine.md) uses it to *find candidates* but
scores them with the full transliteration before deciding a verdict.

## One function, three homes

The same fold must run wherever a key is made: in sggs-data when the database is built, in the
platform at query time, in the app on the device. Three copies, held byte-identical by 24,719
golden vectors — the whole story, with the function read from the source, is
[The Roman fold](../search/the-roman-fold.md).

## What to remember

- Show the transliteration *under* the Gurmukhi and in a lighter style; never in place of it.
- Never cite a transliteration; cite the Gurmukhi line by Ang.
- Never "improve" the transliteration scheme in one place: it is an index, and a change is a
  coordinated dataset release.
- A seeker's misspelling is the fold's job, not the reader's: the first-letters and skeleton tiers
  exist for the same reason.
