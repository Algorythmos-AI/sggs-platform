# Learning paths

A path is a checklist: pages to read and exercises to do, in an order that builds on itself. Tick
items as you go — the ticks are remembered in your browser only (nothing is sent anywhere) — and
start again whenever you like. Every path begins with the same two stops: the
[reverence checklist](../onboarding/reverence-checklist.md) and
[Scripture 101](../scripture/README.md), because the one rule of this project comes before any
code.

    accDescr: Every path starts with the reverence checklist and Scripture 101, then branches: platform engineer, data engineer, iOS engineer, reviewer or scholar.
    start([Reverence checklist · Scripture 101]) --> pe[Platform engineer<br/>the API, search, verification, delivery]
    start --> de[Data engineer<br/>the corpus, the pipeline, the pin, the ledger]
    start --> ie[iOS engineer<br/>the contract, the database pair, Nitnem]
    start --> rs[Reviewer or scholar<br/>what to check, where, and how to say no]
```

<!-- sggs:cards -->
- [Platform engineer](platform-engineer.md) — someone who will change the API, the website or the pipeline that ships them (about two days)
- [Data engineer](data-engineer.md) — someone who will work on the corpus, the database, the gates or a dataset release (about two days)
- [iOS engineer](ios-engineer.md) — someone who will change the app (about a day and a half)
- [Reviewer or scholar](reviewer-scholar.md) — a Granthi, a scholar or a maintainer who reviews changes and never writes code (half a day)

Each exercise on a path is runnable with `make` targets alone and says what output to expect;
the [exercises index](../exercises/README.md) lists them all.
