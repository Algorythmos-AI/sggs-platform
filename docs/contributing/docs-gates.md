# The docs gates

The wiki is gated like the product. Locally, `make docs-check` runs the fast gates in seconds and
`make docs` the full build; in CI the `docs` job of `deploy-docs.yml` runs both on every pull
request and is a **required check on `integration`**.

## `tools/docs_check.py`

| Check | Fails when |
|---|---|
| frontmatter | `title` or `description` missing or the wrong length; the H1 differs from the title |
| links | a relative link or anchor does not resolve on disk; a root-absolute or localhost link |
| widgets | an unknown widget or attribute; no fallback sentence within three lines; a code excerpt's file or symbol missing |
| Mermaid | a colour outside the palette; an `%%{init}` directive; (warning) no `accTitle` |
| scripture | a verse-sized run of Gurmukhi outside a code span; a blockquote without the citation; a cited line that is not verbatim in the pinned database |
| terms | `[[Term]]` names no glossary row |
| verified stamps | a process, engineering or architecture page without one; (warning) code the page cites — a code excerpt, a linked source file, a poster's *Source of truth* — changed after its stamp, or, for a page that cites no code, a stamp 300 commits old |
| posters | the visual spec (legend included); a footer naming a missing file; a sidecar that disagrees with the step groups; a poster no page references |
| drift | a search `mode` the code reports that the waterfall page or poster 05 does not name; a verify threshold poster 07 does not state; a generated page without its header |
| site config | the `/api` rewrite, git deployments off, the CSP (inline scripts by hash only, never `'unsafe-inline'`), no `trailingSlash`, keys Vercel accepts, the sources lock's shape |
| theme | a brand colour in `docs-site/src/styles/theme.css` (paper, card, accent, accent text, accent fill, maroon, kraft, status colours; light and dark) that differs from `docs/brand/tokens.json` |

Pinned sibling pages are checked too, but what only their repository can fix (a palette colour,
a link to an unpinned file) is a notice, never an error.

## Generators and pins

`gen_route_table.py --check`, `gen_contributors.py --check`, `gen_repo_map.py --check` and
`scripts/brand/contrast_report.py --check` fail when a generated page or the repository map is
stale; `fetch_sibling_docs.py --check` fails when a pinned file no longer matches its commit.
Regenerate or re-pin; never edit a generated file.

## The build and after

`npm run typecheck` first; `npm run build` renders every Mermaid fence and every poster; then
`npm run check:all` — `check-render` (every page rendered completely — Astro logs a failed render
and exits 0), `check-nav` (every published page is in the sidebar and marked current on itself, no
sidebar group is empty, no label is longer than 48 characters, and every page has previous and
next links), `check-mermaid`, `check-links` (every internal link and fragment in the built HTML),
`check-budget` (JS per page, largest page) and `check-csp`. Then Playwright with a mocked API on
desktop and phone, axe on **every page the build produced** (from the sitemap), and Lighthouse — on five representative pages
for a pull request, on all twenty nightly and on `main`. The e2e server (`scripts/serve-dist.mjs`) sends the headers `docs-site/vercel.json`
gives production, so every page runs under the real Content-Security-Policy.

### The CSP and its hashes

The site allows inline scripts by their sha256, never with `'unsafe-inline'`. Starlight and the
OpenAPI plugin inline a few small scripts (the theme picker, the sidebar, the search dialog); their
hashes are listed in `docs-site/vercel.json`. They change only when those packages do — so a
Starlight upgrade (often a Dependabot PR) turns `check-csp` red with the exact hashes. Then:

```bash
cd docs-site && npm run build && npm run csp:write
```

and review the diff: every new hash must belong to a script the upgrade brought. A script of your
own belongs in a module file under `src/`, not inline; an inline `on…=` handler or a
`javascript:` URL is refused outright.

## Reading a failure

Each message names the file and line and says what to do (`run: python3 tools/gen_route_table.py`,
`add it to include and run --update`). A red `docs` check on your pull request is one of these
messages, in the job's log, under the step that failed.
