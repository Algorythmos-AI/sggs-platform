# The integrity chain, for engineers

"The [[Gurmukhi]] text is verbatim" is a promise. This page is its proof, end to end: one line of
scripture travels from the source PDF to a reader's screen through six stages, and at every stage
a gate checks that the bytes are still the bytes the PDF printed. Every gate **fails closed**: when
it cannot prove the text, nothing ships, nothing is served, or the app refuses to show scripture.

    accTitle: The integrity chain, from the source PDF to a screen
    accDescr: Six stages, each with the gate that proves the text unchanged — build in sggs-data (reconcile, the golden suite, the ledger), pin in the platform (the sha256 checked at install), serve through the read-only API (health and the contract), watch production (the data canary), bundle into the app (the licence gate and the manifest), and verify at launch (the hash before any line is shown).

    bundle --> launch[6 Launch · the hash, then the text]
    serve --> web[The website and this wiki]

```

## 1. Build — sggs-data proves the corpus against the PDF

The corpus is extracted from the PDF and checked **character for character** against it
(`pipeline/reconcile.py`); the attestation `validation/reconcile-attestation.json` records the PDF's
sha256, because the PDF itself never enters CI. `golden_test.py` checks the structure, the
[editorial ledger](editorial-ledger.md) registers every sanctioned transform (a change to the text
without a reviewed ledger entry fails `ledger_check.py`), and `sggs_integrity.py` fingerprints every
table so a rebuild that changes anything it should not is caught. The full list of build gates is
sggs-data's [scripture integrity](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data/blob/main/docs/architecture/scripture-integrity.md)
page; how the pipeline runs is [the corpus pipeline and gates](pipeline.md).

**Fails closed:** a rebuild that does not reconcile never produces a database.

## 2. Pin — the platform takes exactly the object sggs-data published

`dataset.lock.json` names the sggs-data commit and the database's sha256 and size. `make dataset`
installs the database only if the downloaded bytes hash to the lock (atomically — an interrupted
download leaves nothing behind); `--check-pin` proves the pinned sggs-data commit publishes that very
object, and `--check-repo` proves `contract/_meta.json` — the golden contract's record of the database
it was generated from — names the same sha256. Details: [the dataset pin](dataset-pin.md).

The required `integrity` check runs all of that on every pull request and push, then opens the
installed database and checks `PRAGMA quick_check`, 60,658 lines, and 1,430 contiguous Angs
(`.github/workflows/scripture-integrity.yml`).

**Fails closed:** a pin that does not match what sggs-data publishes cannot merge.

## 3. Serve — a read-only API that proves itself

The API opens the database `mode=ro&immutable=1` with `PRAGMA query_only=ON`
(`webapp/sggs/core.py`) — the application can never write to scripture. `/api/health` is its self-test, and it is what the status strip on this wiki's
home page reads:

| Check | Proves |
|---|---|
| `lines_60658` | exactly 60,658 display lines |
| `angs_1430` | exactly 1,430 distinct Angs |
| `fts5` | full-text search is built and finds a known word |
| `mool_mantar` | the first line of Ang 1 begins with the Mool Mantar, byte for byte |
| `ik_onkar_568` | full-text search finds the invocation in at least 560 lines |
| `verify_engine` | a known line of Ang 1 verifies as `VERIFIED_EXACT` |
| `banis_ok` | the Nitnem registry's Japji is exactly lines 1–385, in order, and its extra lines carry no English |

Every deploy replays the **golden contract** (`contract/golden_*.ndjson`, `tools/contract_http.py`):
production through the new deployment **before** it is promoted, staging after each deploy — so a
response that changed by one byte blocks the release ([contract and OpenAPI](../api/contract-and-openapi.md)).

**Fails closed:** a deployment that fails its smoke or its contract is never promoted.

## 4. Watch — production is re-proven every six hours

Between releases nothing is assumed. The data canary samples production and compares it, byte for
byte, with the pinned database:

<!-- sggs:code file="tools/data_canary.py" lines="1-19" -->
Source: [`tools/data_canary.py`](../../tools/data_canary.py) — its docstring states exactly what is compared.

`.github/workflows/data-canary.yml` runs it every six hours against the API origin **and** through the
public site (so a stale CDN copy is caught too), with 500 random lines and 12 random Angs plus Angs 1,
712 and 1430, then replays the golden contract over HTTP. A difference opens an issue with the seed,
so the exact failure can be replayed.

**Fails closed:** scripture is never "close enough" — one differing byte is a failure.

## 5. Bundle — the app carries the same bytes, certified

The iOS app is built from the same pinned `db/sggs.sqlite`. Its builder writes a manifest beside the
bundled database with the database's `db_sha256` and a `scripture_sha256` over the scripture columns;
the archive gate refuses a build whose scripture checksum differs from the certified corpus, and
proves the manifest inside the finished `.app`. Details:
[database pair and launch integrity](../ios/db-pair-and-launch-integrity.md).

**Fails closed:** an archive whose database does not hash to its manifest is never uploaded.

## 6. Launch — the phone checks before it shows a line

Before any scripture is shown, `LaunchIntegrity` checks the bundled database against the manifest:
a full streaming hash on the first launch and after any change to the install (a fresh install, an
update, a new manifest), and cheap structural checks while its stored fingerprint still matches. If
anything fails, the app refuses to present scripture and shows the report under More → About →
Integrity.

**Fails closed:** a corrupted install shows no scripture at all, never wrong scripture.

## What this chain does not do

- It never **corrects** text. A line that looks wrong is flagged for a Granthi or scholar
  ([the reverence checklist](../onboarding/reverence-checklist.md)); it is not changed.
- Display choices — the Sant Lipi font, the traditional-saroop rendering on the website — are applied
  to what is drawn on screen only. The stored text, the API, search and copy stay verbatim.
- The English translation is a separate, labelled layer, never blended into the Gurmukhi. The app's
  scripture checksum (`scripture_sha256`) covers the scripture rows alone, and the App Store build
  ships the Gurmukhi-only profile.
