# Data & pipeline

Everything the API serves comes from one artifact: a SQLite database of **60,658 line records over
Angs 1–1430**, built by a reproducible pipeline from the source Bir PDF and proven, character for
character, to contain exactly the printed text. That artifact is built, gated and published in the
data repository, [`Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data`](https://github.com/Algorythmos-AI/sggs-data); this
platform never edits it and never commits a copy — it **pins** a commit and a checksum
(`dataset.lock.json`) and installs exactly that object.

> **Prime directive.** The Gurmukhi is sacred and verbatim. Nothing in this platform, and nothing
> described on these pages, rewrites it. The two sanctioned kinds of transform — decoding the PDF
> font's glyph order into logical Unicode, and a handful of scholar-reviewed repairs of impossible
> sequences the font emitted — are registered in the [editorial ledger](editorial-ledger.md) and
> enforced by a gate in sggs-data.

## The pages

<!-- sggs:cards -->
- [Anatomy of a line record](line-record.md) — The 23 columns of the `lines` table, how a page becomes rows, what search reads (Poster 03 walkthrough · a live Ang explorer against the real API)
- [Corpus pipeline and gates](pipeline.md) — `rebuild_all.sh` stage by stage, and the gates that stop it (Poster 04 walkthrough · code read from sggs-data at the pinned commit)
- [The dataset pin](dataset-pin.md) — How this platform obtains the database, what it verifies, how a new dataset arrives (The lock, the fetcher's guarantees, a pin bump end to end)
- [The editorial ledger](editorial-ledger.md) — What may change in the text, what never does, and how a fidelity concern travels (The rules and their applications, the review flow)
- [The integrity chain](integrity-chain.md) — One line of scripture from the source PDF to a screen, and the gate that proves it at each stage (Six stages, each read against the code that enforces it)

## Pinned from sggs-data

The canonical data documents live in the data repository. The wiki publishes them here **by pin**
(`docs-site/sources.lock.json` records the commit and the sha256 of every file), with a banner that
says where the canonical file is; edit them there.

## The numbers that never drift

| Fact | Value | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| Line records | 60,658 | `data_quality.py` (sggs-data), `/api/health` |
| Angs | 1–1430, gap-free | `golden_test.py`, `/api/health` |
| Compositions (`comp_id`) | 4,527 distinct; `max(comp_id)` 5,376; gaps permanent (read from the pinned database) | `verify_regroup.py --invariants` |
| Vaars | 22, detected by title header | `build_vaars.py` |
| Editorial rules / applications | 4 / 11, all reviewed | `ledger_check.py` |
| Dataset served | `dataset.lock.json` → commit, sha256, size | `make dataset-check`, the `scripture-integrity` workflow |
